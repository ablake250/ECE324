2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port PS2_CLK direction INPUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port direction. No other driver was expected for the net (PS2_CLK) connected to this Port, but at least one was found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port PS2_DATA direction INPUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port direction. No other driver was expected for the net (PS2_DATA) connected to this Port, but at least one was found.

2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net CLK100MHZ_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): CLK100MHZ_IBUF_inst/O, dm8_0/CLK100MHZ, videoClk108MHz_0/CLK100MHZ
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock videoClk108MHz_0/inst/CLK100MHZ is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on AN[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on AN[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on AN[2] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on AN[3] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on AN[4] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on AN[5] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on AN[6] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on AN[7] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on CA relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on CB relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#11 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on CC relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#12 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on CD relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#13 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on CE relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#14 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on CF relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#15 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on CG relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock videoClk108MHz_0/inst/CLK100MHZ is created on an inappropriate internal pin videoClk108MHz_0/inst/CLK100MHZ. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
